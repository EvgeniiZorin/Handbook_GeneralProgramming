Left sidebar, tab "Run and Debug".

Debug actions on the Debug toolbar (on the top):
- Continue: resume normal program execution, up to the next breakpoint
- Step Over: execute the next method as a single command without inspecting or following its component steps;
- Step Into: (I prefer this) Enter the next method to follow its execution line-by-line
- Restart
- Stop
